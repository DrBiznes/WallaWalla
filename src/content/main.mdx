## **Introduction**

Selecting Downtown Walla Walla, Washington for my neighborhood observation assignment might seem unconventional. However, a family visit to see my sister, who attends Whitman College, presented a unique opportunity to conduct fieldwork in a different city than Eugene. This quick Easter trip allowed me to explore downtown Walla Walla and the adjacent Whitman College area, providing valuable comparative insights that complement our course's focus on neighborhood development and transformation.

This was my third time visiting the city, and second staying at the Marcus Whitman Hotel. The hotel's namesake, as I would discover through my research, connects to a complex colonial history that fundamentally shaped the region through conflict between early white settlers and the indigenous Cayuse, Walla Walla, and Umatilla peoples.

Downtown Walla Walla and the neighboring Whitman College area form an interesting study in contrast and connection. The carefully preserved 19th-century commercial buildings downtown house contemporary businesses, while just a few blocks away, the college campus creates its own distinct neighborhood identity. The physical proximity yet distinct feel of these areas provided ample opportunity for analysis.

Something that makes Walla Walla interesting for this observation assignment is how this small city (population approximately 33,000) has experienced various economic transformations throughout its history, from its origins as a military and trading outpost, to an agricultural center, and more recently to a destination for wine tourism. These economic shifts have left visible imprints on the built environment and social fabric of the downtown area.

## **The Historical Context of Walla Walla**

Before exploring downtown Walla Walla, I wanted to understand the historical context that shaped this unique place. Professor Sandoval's neighborhood observation approach emphasizes that historical knowledge provides critical insights into contemporary urban form and community dynamics. Following his methodology, I began by researching the area's development before conducting my walking observation.

What struck me most was how Walla Walla's evolution from indigenous homeland to wine tourism destination represents multiple economic transformations, each leaving distinct imprints on the built environment. The land was originally home to the Cayuse, Umatilla, and Walla Walla tribes long before European settlement.

The pivotal moment in colonial history came in 1836 when Marcus and Narcissa Whitman established a mission called Waiilatpu. Their presence ended tragically in 1847 when a measles epidemic devastated the indigenous population. The Cayuse, observing that white children often survived while their children died, concluded that Whitman was poisoning them. Following their cultural practice, they killed the Whitmans and eleven others in what settlers called the "Whitman Massacre."

This violent episode accelerated American military presence and settlement. Having stayed at the Marcus Whitman Hotel multiple times, I found learning about this complex history jarring. The hotel's name celebrates a figure whose legacy is deeply intertwined with colonization and indigenous displacement, yet this history remains largely unacknowledged in the building that now anchors downtown's identity.

The gold rush of the 1860s transformed Walla Walla into Washington Territory's largest settlement, explaining the ornate Victorian commercial buildings I observed downtown. When gold fever subsided, agriculture took over — Italian immigrants introduced the famous Walla Walla sweet onions, while German immigrants established dryland wheat farming.

What's most fascinating about Walla Walla's history is how recent its wine-centered identity actually is. While the region has long been agricultural, it wasn't until the 1970s that the first modern wineries emerged. By the early 2000s, the industry had exploded, with downtown buildings that once housed general stores and banks during the gold rush now repurposed as tasting rooms. This economic transformation has reinvigorated Walla Walla's historic architecture while simultaneously creating a somewhat staged tourist experience that sits in tension with the city's working-class roots.

## **Walking Through Downtown: The Built Environment**

### **Architectural Heritage in Walla Walla**

I began my observation on Rose Street, one of the main east-west arterial roads in downtown Walla Walla where the Marcus Whitman Hotel stands as a 13-story Renaissance Revival landmark from 1928. This imposing structure dominates the skyline and served as my starting point. From Rose Street, I moved just a block south to Main Street, which presents the heart of downtown's commercial district.

Walking along Main Street on a cool April morning, I was immediately struck by the remarkably cohesive historic streetscape. Unlike many small towns where historic buildings are interspersed with modern structures, Walla Walla's downtown presents an intact collection of late 19th and early 20th century American architecture.

What fascinated me most was seeing how these historic buildings have been repurposed rather than replaced. The Baker Boyer Bank building, founded in 1869 as Washington's first bank, maintains its huge brick façade while housing modern banking services. Throughout downtown, I noticed numerous buildings proudly displaying their original painted logos and signage, even as they've been converted to new uses.

This pattern of adaptive reuse appeared consistently throughout downtown and surrounding blocks. The ornate details of cornices, window surrounds, and decorative brickwork have been meticulously maintained, creating a distinctive sense of place that feels authentic despite serving contemporary commercial purposes. It became clear that Walla Walla has strategically leveraged its architectural heritage as both cultural asset and economic engine for its wine tourism industry.

### **Streets and Public Spaces: Form and Function**

The streets and public spaces of downtown Walla Walla reveal an interesting tension between pedestrian-friendly intentions and surprisingly expansive roadways. Main Street features wide sidewalks, decorative planters, street trees, and human-scale lighting that create a pleasant walking environment. I was particularly drawn to a pedestrian plaza where a small creek or canal runs through the middle of the space, creating a soothing water feature that enhances the downtown experience.

Walking through Heritage Square, I discovered a large wall display labeled "Odd Fellows Temple" featuring numerous historic photographs of the town. The old images offered glimpses into Walla Walla's past that contrasted sharply with the present-day reality I was observing. What struck me most was the disconnection between the human-scaled downtown of old and today's unnecessarily wide streets that seemed designed less for residents and more for accommodating hordes of wandering wine tourists. Perhaps the generous dimensions of Rose Street exist to ensure that day-drunk visitors from Seattle can comfortably weave their way between tasting rooms without bumping into each other or, heaven forbid, their luxury SUVs parked along both sides. The streetscape has clearly been crafted to project an image of small-town charm while maximizing the capacity for tourism traffic.

## **Social Dynamics and Economic Realities**

### **Authentic Charm or Wine Tourism Stage Set**

My walking observation revealed a striking contradiction in downtown Walla Walla. While the area boasts impeccably preserved 19th-century architecture, its current function serves a remarkably narrow purpose. Approximately 80% of storefronts now house wine tasting rooms, upscale restaurants, or boutiques catering specifically to wine tourists rather than everyday community needs.

Walking back to the Marcus Whitman Hotel from Whitman College in the evening, I was struck by how completely deserted downtown had become. Despite pleasant spring weather, Main Street was nearly deserted by 8 PM. The beautiful infrastructure seemed to exist primarily for creating an idyllic wine country experience during limited daytime hours rather than supporting community or college life.

This tension between architectural authenticity and tourist-oriented function raises important questions about who benefits from this form of preservation and what genuine community spaces might look like beyond the carefully crafted wine tourism experience.

### **Two Neighborhoods, Parallel Inauthenticities**

The Whitman College area just north of downtown revealed a fascinating parallel to the wine district. Crossing Boyer Avenue, I observed an immediate transition from commercial tourism to institutional control. Signs of institutional ownership were everywhere, with the Whitman College logo appearing on numerous buildings, most notably the many family homes now converted for college use. This created another form of controlled space distinct from but similar to downtown's wine-tourism focus.

Conversations with several of my sister's friends at Whitman revealed a common sentiment - they all described experiencing the town as somewhat artificial in different ways. Many worked at the upscale restaurants downtown but noted these establishments were priced too high for students to actually patronize, leaving them with just a handful of affordable dining options aside from chains like Chipotle. This economic disconnect highlighted how students simultaneously serve and are excluded from the wine tourism economy that dominates downtown.

What I find most revealing about Walla Walla's urban dynamics is how these two distinct spheres - educational and touristic - have effectively reshaped the town's core identity. Whitman College enrolls approximately 1,500 students in a city of 33,000. Meanwhile, tourism figures show Walla Walla hosting over 200,000 visitors annually, many drawn specifically to wine experiences. The permanent resident population exists alongside these temporary populations, creating a complex demographic landscape where different groups experience entirely different versions of the same physical space.

This demographic reality manifests visibly in both built environment and social dynamics. While these carefully maintained areas project an image of thriving community life, they actually represent specialized environments serving temporary populations - students who will graduate and tourists who will return home. I wonder how do long-term residents who fall outside these categories experience their hometown when its most visible spaces cater so specifically to others?

This visualization would illustrate how temporary populations significantly influence the town's economic and physical development despite being transient. The chart could include additional elements showing the growth of wineries over time (from just a handful in the 1980s to over 120 today) alongside tourism numbers, demonstrating how this industry has transformed downtown.**

## **Conclusion**

Walla Walla's downtown represents a compelling study in contradictions. Its impeccably preserved historic architecture houses a narrowly focused wine tourism economy, creating an environment that feels simultaneously authentic in form and artificial in function. This tension between physical preservation and social transformation extends to the neighboring Whitman College area, where institutional control similarly creates spaces that serve temporary populations passing through rather than putting down roots. Together, these parallel environments reveal how communities can successfully leverage heritage assets for economic revitalization while inadvertently creating divided spaces that exclude many permanent residents through both economic and institutional barriers.

What my observation revealed is a fundamental question about the purpose of public space in small towns undergoing economic transition: Is preserving buildings enough if the resulting spaces don't foster genuine community integration? Walla Walla's success in creating a destination for wine tourists and an attractive setting for college students demonstrates the power of physical preservation, but its empty evening streets and economic barriers point to the limitations of development strategies that prioritize visitor experiences over resident needs.
